                 Manual Technical Interviews are extremely effort intensive for enterprises and takes a huge toll on their HR and Technical teams. This process of manual interviews often adversely impacts the quality of candidates and onboarding time that lead to multi million dollars of business losses.
                 The core issue is VIB don’t have time, effort and ability to determine the right people. So I wondered if it would be possible to have a bot that would complete a more reasonable judgement of the candidate, based on its build-in knowledge and the criteria of the employer.
                 90% of resume is totally a waste of time, because the packaging for resumes is definitely overdone at the moment. Compared to the words, video might be the better alternative for the employers. Altrought the use of video still won't prevent cheating, it should significantly improve accuracy and the amount of information included.
                So this is the initial idea of VIB, it’s a combination product of AI knowledge, video analysis and bot.
                VIB clearly understands the huge potential in automating this critical business function and leverage Deep tech with NLP to take the technical interviews to whole new level. VIB  can conduct technical video interviews in realtime and also auto evaluate the candidate responses without any involvement from the technical experts. It’s state of the art algorithms record and evaluate candidate response and tailors the next question based on previous answers. This adaptive interview style gives it a real life feel and takes away the performance stress on candidates usually involved during manual interviews. It thus enables the candidates to showcase their best skills which ultimately helps the organization to acquire the best talent.
                The Bot automatically evaluate candidate response and create a Report.
               VIB is fast disrupting the technical evaluation market by evaluating candidates on expertise rather than experience.
